The && operator can be used to simplify nested if statements. For example, following code can be rewritten with a single condition.
 
if (x == 0) {
    if (y == 0) {
    System.out.println("Both x and y are zero");
    } 
}
// combined
if (x == 0 && y == 0) {
    System.out.println("Both x and y are zero"); 
}

Likewise, the || operator can simplify chained if statements. Since the branches are the same, there is no need to duplicate that code.
